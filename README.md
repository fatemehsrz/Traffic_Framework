# Temporal_Graph_Analysis

Traffic forecasting with the presence of time series and networked data

# ToDo
- [ ] The goal is to predict the speed of cars in the US cities (Los Angels, San Bernardino, and San Francisco)



**Speed prediction**
- [x] Dataset from [ASTGCN](https://github.com/Davidham3/ASTGCN) and [TGCN](https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN/tree/master/data)
- [x] Converting the data into json format avaiable at [Fatemeh github](https://github.com/fatemehsrz/json_files)
- [x] Visualizing graphs
- [x] Running baselines [Pytorch_Geometric_Temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal) to predict the speed
- [x] Comparing the results
